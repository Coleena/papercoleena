	As we face our fragile tomorrow,<br/>
	we both believe in a miracle to come<br/>
	Spreading my wounded wings,<br/>
	I take flight; true heart<br/>

	Those sleepless mornings, I trembled<br/>
	as I leant against the cold wall<br/>
	And murmured the same thing over and over again<br/>

	I spent my days unable to find anything to grasp,<br/>
	hoping something would come along<br/>
	All I want is your love<br/>

<tr><td>
	Turn around and hold me right now<br/>
	Ah, accept these feelings overflowing uncontrollably<br/>
	As I gaze into the darkness gradually turning to dawn<br/>
	Ah, I dream of the light uniting us that will someday come<br/>

	Spilling from the edges, my love begins to melt<br/>
	Ah, it flows outwards, following its way across your chest<br/>
	The past me, ah, is falling apart<br/>
	There's no stopping it now - you're filling me head to toe<br/>

	At a stop, I search but can't find your figure<br/>
	Ah, yet your voice reaches my ears from far away<br/>
