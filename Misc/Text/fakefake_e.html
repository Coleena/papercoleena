    Don't listen to the BGM<br/>
	Sugarless is just half-assed - I don't need it, don't need it<br/>
	With each other, step, step, step<br/>
	Take me on a bullet train ride, please<br/>
	A merry-go-round isn't enough, not enough<br/>
	Don't tell me A to Z - show me what you mean<br/>
	The nooks of my brain I can't erase, can't erase<br/>
	Break the GPS; I'm a little unable to wait<br/>
	It's all your fault - 3, 2, 1<br/>

	Hey, Mr. Sunday - wait, please care about me<br/>
	Follow the course of time and wind up my spring<br/>
	Hey, Mr. Sunday - wait, please care about me<br/>

	Make some noise - clap, clap clap<br/>
	Being careful is useless<br/>
	Playing make-believe is a no-no, a no-no<br/>
	Avoid scoring MVP, hurl away your opportunities<br/>
	My left ear on its own isn't enough, not enough<br/>
	Pile them up - stock, stock, stock<br/>
	Provoking others is a no-no<br/>
	The cards laid out before me I can't pull, can't pull<br/>
	Let me out, get home quick<br/>
	Yeah, like that full-length novel kid - 3, 2, 1<br/>

	The taste of the poison apple... Just like my right hand.<br/>
	What does an incomplete blink taste like?<br/>
	'cause I'm sure it's coated<br/> in bottomless sweetness...<br/>
	The mirror reflects only lies<br/>
	since your voice is all inside-out, isn't it?<br/>
