    Joined hands</br>
    I can no longer see the color of the wind</br>
    Trembling in fear</br>
    My body is being consumed in flames</br>
    I can't trust anything anymore</br>
    I don't believe it anymore cause I feel sad</br>
    Not a thing will change, no matter how much I reminisce</br>

    and despair, they fall and disappear</br>

    but I can at least see in front of me</br>
    Scary, man!</br>

    The wall of categorization between organisms<br/>
