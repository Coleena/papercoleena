	A train bursting at the seams<br/>
	Even during the most unpleasant times<br/>
	Just thinking of seeing you this weekend would make the time fly<br/>
	I've come all this way watching you over a friend's shoulder<br/>
	So could you praise me for having been able to say that I like you?<br/>

	Another scandal in the weekly magazine ads hanging in the train<br/>
	I don't want to become a lying adult<br/>
	If only we could jump into a world with just the two of us<br/>

	In this turbulent age of nothing but fake love<br/>
	Earnestly, I offer to only you every single bit of my love<br/>
	If it could be taken away by someone, I'll hold onto it so tight it breaks<br/>
	I love you - do you think could I cling to your arm just a bit longer?<br/>

<tr><td>
	Doing up my hair in a way that matches your preferences<br/>
	I'm a little lacking in self-confidence as is<br/>
	But I bet you'd get tired of plain cuteness<br/>
	Boys are so selfish - have I already lost by falling for you?<br/>

	I'm listening to that Taylor you like, once again<br/>
	Getting a hair dye doesn't sound like a bad idea<br/>
	Though I still lose my balance when I don't hold onto the hanging straps<br/>

<tr><td>
	You and I now climb the staircase to adulthood<br/>
	Earnestly, one step at a time, stepping our ground carefully<br/>
	Whenever you feel sad, I'll put a smile on your face<br/>
	Always right by your side, let's keep holding hands<br/>
	Hold mine tight<br/>

	Love, wishes, encounters, building up the future<br/>
	The miracle that we, out of 100 million, were bound together<br/>
	The moment that we first kissed<br/>
	Revealed the reason why we were born<br/>

	In this turbulent age of nothing but fake love<br/>
	Earnestly, I offer to only you every single bit of my love<br/>
	I'll always be by your side, because I'm your number one supporter<br/>
	I love you - do you think could I cling to your arm just a bit longer?<br/>
	I want to keep living on for your sake<br/>
