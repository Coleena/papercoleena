    On the first floor of a wood apartment,<br/>
	he drew, completely engrossed in painting<br/>
	What he'd wanted to paint was his own self,<br/>
	a world that would surround and capture him<br/>
	Ever since he was little, he liked drawing<br/>
	That was because everyone praised him for it<br/>
	But now, the only one who praises him<br/>
	is his girlfriend living with him<br/>

	But that was all he needed to be happy<br/>
	Each day, they happened to miss each other<br/>
	but she always left him letters<br/>
	on sakura-patterned stationery;	those were dear to him<br/>
	Before they knew it, the night had ended<br/>
	Before they knew it, the sun had set<br/>
	Before they knew it, winter had reached its end<br/>
	That day, for the first time, his art sold<br/>

	By then, their circumstances had<br/>
	begun to constantly change<br/>
	The next month, all his paintings sold<br/>
	And what kept on changing<br/>
	was always the scenery...<br/>
	Everyone praised his paintings<br/>
	And she happily told him this:<br/>
	"I was right to have believed..."<br/>

	Sometimes, he received thank-you letters<br/>
	from the people who bought his art<br/>
	He had no memory of ever being thanked,<br/>
	but it didn't feel strange, either<br/>
	The small room began to fill bit by bit<br/>
	with treasures, which made him happy<br/>
	And he thought to himself how wonderful it'd be<br/>
	if things could stay like this forever...<br/>

	He gradually began to like drawing more and more<br/>
	He wanted to create even grander paintings<br/>
	What he wanted to paint was his own self,<br/>
	to paint an even closer truth<br/>
	He finished his greatest masterpiece<br/>
	Even she smiled and said, "It's wonderful"<br/>
	It was a painting of the true miserable nature of humans,<br/>
	one that would make anyone turn their eyes away...<br/>

	Everyone knitted their eyebrows in disgust at his painting<br/>
	Retreating like the water's tide,<br/>
	each and every one person left<br/>
	And what kept on changing<br/>
	was always the scenery...<br/>
	The people all ridiculed him, calling him incompetent<br/>
	Their fights increasing, the two of them eventually broke up<br/>
	Was I wrong to have believed...?<br/>

	On the first floor of a wood apartment,<br/>
	he continues to draw, even now<br/>
	What I'd wanted to paint was my own self,<br/>
	what turned out to be an empty shell of my own self...<br/>
	I've liked drawing ever since I was little<br/>
	Now, I don't even know why anymore<br/>
	There's no one left who'll praise me<br/>
	There's no more names I can give to these piles of paintings<br/>

	How many months, how many years<br/>
	have passed without me realizing?<br/>
	That day, for the first time in a while,<br/>
	a single painting of mine sold<br/>
	And what kept on changing<br/>
	was always the scenery...<br/>
	From that buyer came a letter<br/>
	Just a few words written on sakura-patterned stationery<br/>
	"I was right to have believed in you..."<br/>
