	I hit the stop button on my alarm and stretch deeply<br/>
	The sun smiles down on us; breathe in happiness<br/>
	We are superheroes, you and I both, because we possess true strength<br/>
	welling up from the bottom of our hearts<br/>
	It's a heart-pounding, windy morning<br/>
	C'mon, we've gotta go, to the place of our fight<br/>

	I rush up the stairs, test my quick wits<br/>
	Today feels like one of those days I can run on at full determination<br/>
	That dark heat haze of a coward<br/>
	I'll turn it into a kind-hearted angel, just watch!<br/>

<tr><td>
	All right, we are superheroes<br/>
	Anyone and everyone has their own twinkle power within<br/>
	Even if we cry a bit, I strongly want to believe<br/>
	Right here, right now, is just the start line<br/>

	In a distant, faraway place where a voice calls out to me<br/>
	You must be there, crying all alone<br/>
	I want to see you, precious and irreplaceable to me, right now<br/>
	I want to fly to your side<br/>

<tr><td>
	All right, we are superheroes<br/>
	When you're looking downwards, eyebrows furrowed<br/>
	Let me grasp your hand and stay by your side<br/>
	Even when we're apart, I'm watching over you<br/>
	Yes, that's right - you're a superhero, too<br/>
	There will never be any sadness such as this again<br/>
	Just give the acceleration pedal in your chest a gentle push<br/>

	I've won and I've lost<br/>
	"Without comparing yourself to anyone else..."<br/>
	Your enemy is right here<br/>
	"Dwelling deep within you..."<br/>
	Stand up! Stand up!<br/>
	Build up your energy<br/>
	"It's too early to admit defeat."<br/>

	We're heroes who still have nights we cry<br/>
	Not everyone can be strong all the time<br/>
	Anxiety and loneliness<br/>
	Turn those kinds of words around, and then walk once more<br/>
