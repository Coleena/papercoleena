	Not at the fault of you or anyone else,<br/>
	you fell down in the middle of the road<br/>
	and just laid there, <br/>
	looking up at the blue sky<br/>
	The shining tears rolling down your cheeks<br/>
	aren't for show<br/>
	You can't forget the joy of being alive<br/>
	after you've come this far<br/>
	When you get back up after falling to your knees,<br/>
	your back is covered in mud<br/>
	The pain of those wounds will cheer you on<br/>

	Your beloved friends<br/>
	aren't here anymore<br/>
	despite having promised so sincerely<br/>
	to pursue the same dreams together<br/>
	No matter how small you are<br/>
	or however powerless you seem,<br/>
	let's believe that the promise we made that day<br/>
	will someday be fulfilled<br/>
	Whenever you shrink back and cast your eyes downwards,<br/>
	on the verge of crying,<br/>
	summon the courage to start walking again<br/>
	To the future!<br/>
