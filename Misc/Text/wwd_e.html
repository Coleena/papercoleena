	I'd been bullied and shut myself away in my room<br/>
	The arcade was the only place where I felt like I fit in<br/>
</td></tr>

	My dreams had fallen apart, and I'd become desperate<br/>
	But before I knew it, I was here smiling with everyone<br/>

	The radio was my only friend<br/>
	I had a horrible case of chuunibyou, and scared everyone away<br/>

	Living in the countryside,<br/> I'd always wanted to be like anime and manga characters<br/>
	Akiba is my holy land, and here I live!<br/>

	For the longest time, I'd played MMOs, never leaving my room<br/>
	Because my two hands weren't enough,<br/>
	I used my feet to push the function keys<br/>

	Although we stand on a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny<br/> stage right now<br/>
	we'll someday take flight into the big, big, big,<br/>big world<br/>

	Don't look down on us just because<br/>we started out as less than nobodies!<br/>

	Even if everything's all jumbled up<br/>

	I didn't want to go to school.<br/>I just played MMOs.<br/>
	Online, I'm not lonely.<br/>
	I was the same. I didn't want to take<br/>a single step out of my room.<br/>
	To me, MMOs were everything.<br/>
	While fighting an an enemy party in my favorite MMO,<br/> I... saw her.<br/>
	Yeah. In a rival party.<br/>
	We were mutual enemies!<br/>

	I've been a cosplayer ever since I was little!<br/>
	The world of cosplaying was so cute and radiant,<br/>and I'd looked up to it.<br/>
	I'd always watched her. She was so small, and shined so bright.<br/>
	Meanwhile, I couldn't do anything...<br/>
	Time went by, and I became a high-schooler.<br/>
	Time went by, and I became the lead maid.<br/>
	Yet for some reason, the two of us...<br/>
	....are here together.<br/>

	I had despaired over my powerlessness.<br/>I didn't know why I was in Akihabara...<br/>
	There was this girl in the maid cafe I worked at.<br/>She was really cute, and seemed so lonely...<br/>
	She put a huge smile on my face,<br/>even with my wounded heart.<br/>
	I wanted to help her out,<br/>even just a little.<br/>
	And so the two of us met...<br/>
