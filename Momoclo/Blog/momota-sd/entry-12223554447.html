<div>This is my adorable, adorable son!</div>
<div>He's very shy,</div>
<div>and often doesn't come even when I call for him,</div>
<div>but his level of cuteness when he jumps at me is just ♡</div>
<div>I can't handle it 😍</div>

<div>He's always touching my ears,</div>
<div>and I had no idea why until I touched them myself! I realized they are considerably soft. LOL</div>

<div>I'm looking forward to seeing him grow!</div>
