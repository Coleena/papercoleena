<div>Today, I went to the Mori Art Museum in Roppongi</div>
<div>to see their Marie Antoinette exhibition ðŸ‘¸</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>My face is stiff from the cold. LOL</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Once again, I went with Mama, lol</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Because it's a Marie Antoinette exhibition,</div>
<div>A-rin picked out and wore the most palace-y clothes out of all her western clothes â™¡</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I wanted to take off my coat to take a pic,</div>
<div>but in any case, it was too cold so I couldn't. LOL</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Green skirts are uncommon~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A-rin bought this skirt with more of a</div>
<div>"Proofreader Girl" kind of image in mind,</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but from now on, I'm calling it a palace-style skirt instead! LOL</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I usually dress up whenever I go out to art museums,</div>
<div>but just picking out western clothes to wear is fun too~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So, onto the main topic.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The Marie Antoinette exhibition</div>
<div>made me feel like I'd actually went back in time.</div>
<div>I couldn't pull my eyes away from the the paintings, the luxuries she'd possessed, the objects she wore until the end, the letters she left behind, and all the other things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I set aside 2 hours to give myself time to view them all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In paintings, her skin, the elasticity of the lace, and her kind smile</div>
<div>were all tender,</div>
<div>and yet it also delicately presented the pearls, her accessories, the lustre and feel of the silk material her dresses were made of...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It was like Marie Antoinette was actually right there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So many things Marie Antoinette used were femininely sweet and cute,</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yet at the same time, I could feel the strength to live with fate among all that beauty.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A-rin goes to art exhibitions often,</div>
<div>so it was fun because of how different it felt (^^)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I recommend it especially to you girls out there~ â™¡</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Check it out sometime!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Oh, and also,</div>
<div>A-rin's part in "Ai wo Tsugu Mono"</div>
<div>is about Marie Antoinette.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I can sing it with even more feeling now.</div>
