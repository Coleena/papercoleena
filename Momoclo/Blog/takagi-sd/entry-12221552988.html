<div>Mononofu who came from Japan.</div>
<div>Local mononofu.</div>
<div>I was really glad that so many mononofu came at Hawaii, Los Angeles, and New York.</div>
<div>I mean, I really did think that no one would come.</div>
<div>Our group is active primarily in Japan, so I had no idea that there were this many mononofu overseas, and was really happy to learn that there were people who knew us outside of Japan!</div>
<div>There were people who said "I love you".</div>
<div>There were people who called out "Reni-chan". There where people who cried out of happiness. Even though I'm the one happy to see you 😭💜 I was truly happy. I wish we could've talked more, stayed in the same atmosphere 😖 So I'll definitely come see you again!! Promise 💗 That's why I'd like you to please keep cheering us on!</div>
<div>It also made me really happy to see Japnese mononofu having fun talking with overseas mononofu. Watching everyone join hands to cheer us was moving beyond words 😁💜</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>There are probably mononofu out there in the world we haven't met as well. I've got to work hard so we can go meet them!</div>
<div>We live on the same planet, yet our dates and times are different. But I found once again that everyone's desire to cheer for us, and everyone's smiles, are universal.</div>
<div>Thank you so much, everyone 💜</div>
