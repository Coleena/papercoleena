<div>And so, Momoiro Christmas 2016 ~Midwinter Sun-Sun-Summertime~</div>
<div>has ended after a period of 2 days! Ah, it's over...</div>
<div>It was so fun, I was sure I wouldn't be able to sleep again at night 😁💜</div>
<div>It was hella hot!! Like "aloha~"</div>
<div>Where should I start! Hm, I'll start from the beginning 🤗 </div>
<div>When we had dress rehearsal the day before the performance, I mentioned I wanted to do something with A-chan, so we cosplayed as a reindeer and snowman! Aren't we cute? 😍 And then, and then! We exchanged presents with the band members and staff 🎁</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And then! On performance day, my heart was pounding so hard, like always! Everyone is really amazing, you know! They can make me smile instantly even though I was so nervous!</div>
<div>I really love everyone so much 🙋 </div>
<div>On the first day, Takagi Boo-san played the ukelele in our yearly tradition of Reni-chan Magic.</div>
<div>Somehow, whenever I see Boo-san, my chest gets really tight. You see, I came across him waiting below the stage for our rehearsal to end, and he said "I'm always wearing your hat." And right in front of me, he was wearing a purple hat that had "Taka" written on it.</div>
<div>I don't know what this feeling that's come up since then is, but my chest gets tight. I want him to come to another one of our live performances 😄</div>
<div>And on the second day, pro wrestler Koshinaka Shiro-san came in!!</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We actually held a talk together previously!!</div>
<div>He really a wonderful person, and kind to everyone he meets at any time...</div>
<div>To me, he's an aspiration! I want to become someone like this, an hero invincible in any position!</div>
<div>Let's leave one of Reni-chan's even better points for next year!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So, over the course of the live performance...</div>
<div>The time that we spent together was the best Christmas present to me!! Thank you so much!!</div>
<div>It really makes me happy when we make eye contact ☺ It's uplifting.</div>
<div>It also makes me happy when I wave and you wave back 😊</div>
<div>It also makes me happy when I hear my name called out 😊</div>
<div>But what makes me happier than anything in the world is when you love me 😊</div>
<div>Haa~ I can't stop sighing out of happiness~ What should I do~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>But in the end, if you all are happy with us, then that's my #1 happiness!</div>
