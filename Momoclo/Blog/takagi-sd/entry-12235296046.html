<div>I went to Yabitsu Pass with my friend, I've always wanted to see the night scenery there ( ´∀｀)</div>
<div>We were laughing our guts out the whole time!! I laughed so much my stomach hurt!! LOL</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The night scenery and the starry sky were super pretty.</div>
<div>It didn't really show up in the pictures, but for real, the stars were so close it felt like I could touch them. The sky was like a planetarium⭐️ It was impressive. I wished I could've kept watching them forever and forget about the cold!!</div>
<div>In the summer, I'd like to bring a picnic cloth and watch the stars while eating rice balls ✨💜❤💜❤</div>
<div>I may be 23,,, but I felt like I was living my youth...</div>
<div>After that, y'see, we went to the Osanbashi Pier and took a stroll, like in "Burari Takagi Reni"~😊!!</div>
<div>We watched the ships, ate jagariko, took lots of pics with a selfie stick, LOL</div>
<div>That place, see, is a place of good memories! I often took walks there with my family!! It was cold, but fun 😁✌️</div>
<div>It's a really small thing, but I love being able to laugh so hard my stomach hurts!!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So, today was a hardcore cold Day!</div>
<div>On a day like this, I sat back and had hot tea with a souffle pancake 🤤💓</div>
<div>Happiness~ 🤗</div>
