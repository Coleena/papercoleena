<div>It's already been one week since the start of the new year!</div>
<div>Doesn't time go by super fast after New Year's?</div>
<div>I've felt that way eeever since elementary school!!</div>
<div>I bet it's because we have so much fun when all our relatives come over!</div>
<div>Out of all my relatives, there's quite a few that are around my age, so we feel basically like siblings! With me being the youngest! We fought all the time when we were little, but really started getting along once we grew up!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And!! On a different topic,</div>
<div>My friend from America sent me sweets!!!</div>
