    At a loss for words,<br/>
    I instinctively place my hand on your shoulder<br/>
    You silently,<br/>
    coldheartedly brush it off<br/>
    From the smallest of misunderstandings,<br/>
    our still-young love breaks down<br/>
    I don't want to see you look so sad<br/>

    We vow we will someday<br/>
    build up the future with our own hands<br/>
    right here on this planet,<br/>
    wherever you may be<br/>
    But in the present,<br/>
    we avert our eyes wistfully<br/>
    Believe that we will meet again...<br/>

    Hey, yo! Boys and girls<br/>
    All coincidences are inevitabilities<br/>
    We chose and were born in this universe,<br/>
    so let's continue to burn the flame of life<br/>
    We can do that, don't give up on yourself<br/>
    I know, within your chest<br/>
    your sharp, overflowing passion is like a diamond<br/>
    This is the start; 3, 2, 1, go!<br/>
