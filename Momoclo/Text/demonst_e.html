	Once again, reality had changed<br/>
	into a falsehood behind my back.<br/>
	The things adult stressed to be important yesterday<br/>
	turned 180 degrees different today.<br/>
	Stop, Earth! Stand still, Earth!<br/>
	It's your fault the truth turns into lies!<br/>
	The lies become the truth!<br/>
	You know, Galileo, before I knew it,<br/>
	I'd lost the coordinates of justice and evil as they yet rotate.<br/>
	Don't be so full of yourself, universe!<br/>
	We won't let you do as you please forever.<br/>
	No matter how much the Earth tries to provoke us,<br/>
	we won't ever change.<br/>
	I'll stop the Earth!<br/>

	Just a moment, world and people<br/>
	Inspire me next, here we go<br/>
	See, among all the words I've believed up until now,<br/>
	I wonder how many I can call the truth<br/>
	However many times I'm deceived, I won't hesitate<br/>
	I don't want to lose the battle against myself<br/>
	Gravity, gravity; my tears fall<br/>
	Gravity, gravity<br/>
	At this rate, we'll forever be at the whim of this planet<br/>
	Right now, I'm going to take off, away from this place!<br/>
	You're fine just the way you are<br/>
	Wipe away those tears<br/>
	C'mon, let's get started! See,<br/>
	even I can take flight<br/>
	Everything I can believe in without doubt, everything 100% certain<br/>
	I'll find them, one by one, with my own hands<br/>
	Just a moment, world and people<br/>
	Inspire me next, here we go<br/>
	Ah, among all the words I've uttered up until now,<br/>
	I wonder how many I truly have confidence in<br/>
	I don't want to ever betray someone<br/>
	Always, I want to live honestly<br/>
	Gravity, gravity; the rain is cold on my skin<br/>
	Gravity, gravity<br/>
	From any storm, any blizzard, I don't want to run or avoid<br/>
	Right away, I'm going to set off, away from this place!<br/>

	You're fine just the way you are<br/>
	Don't tell yourself otherwise<br/>
	C'mon, I'll tell you! Right now<br/>
	Even I can raise my voice<br/>
	The ability to believe in myself, all that I can be proud of<br/>
	I'll discover them, bit by bit, with my own eyes<br/>
	Whatever it takes<br/>
	Hey, Galileo?<br/>
	I'm going to try doing things my own way.<br/>
	No matter how much I'm made fun of,<br/>
	I absolutely won't give in. Isn't that right?<br/>
	I've already stepped out so far<br/>
	The rain has stopped, and so have the tears<br/>
	Just a little further<br/>
	Almost there! I'm almost there!<br/>
	With this body, this heart, using these legs, these fingers,<br/>
	I'll kick the earth and take off!<br/>
	Fly high!<br/>
	You're fine just the way you are<br/>
	Wipe away those tears<br/>
	C'mon, let's get started! See,<br/>
	even I can take flight<br/>
	Everything I can believe in without doubt, everything 100% certain<br/>
	I'll find them, one by one, with my own hands<br/>
	I'll grasp them firmly<br/>
	Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!<br/>
