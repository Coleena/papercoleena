	we continue to fight against something unseen<br/>
	On a completely fresh canvas,<br/>
	we simply continue to draw...<br/>

	When you feel like you're brimming with strength,<br/>
	paint in a passionate red<br/>
	Let's keep moving forwards<br/>
	without fear of conflict or wounds<br/>

	paint in a hopeful yellow<br/>
	Smiles never failing,<br/>
	let's share our joy with others<br/>

	As we meet all sorts of different colors atop life's palette,<br/>
	we fill up our blank-white palettes all the way<br/>
	We'll continue to draw out our dreams,<br/>

	Under the huge skies of this planet<br/>

	When you add tears to your passion,<br/>
	you make the color purple<br/>
	Endure past the anxiety and loneliness<br/>
	on days where nothing goes well<br/>
	When you add tears to your hope,<br/>
	you make the color green<br/>
	If you're tired, don't be afraid to take a break<br/>
	before setting off again<br/>

	Whatever color we're missing, there's still no way<br/>

	It's love??! (Love!)<br/>
	It's a koi!! (Oi!)<br/>
	Your face is distinct?! (Face!)<br/>
	Come more!!!! (Awright!)<br/>

	More distinct!!!! (Whee!)<br/>
	Come, spring!!!! (Hold up, hold up!)<br/>
