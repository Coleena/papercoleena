    Visibility nearly lost in a flash of light<br/>
	Emotions to fog; a dizzy sense of equilibrium<br/>
	The illusion wavers; an unseen style<br/>
	Feeling as though you're floating, like in the legends<br/>
</tr></td>
<tr><td>
	The story being played back<br/>
	has lost its way in a corridor,<br/>
	as if it were chasing the shadow of a swimming bird<br/>
	Where are you? What are you doing?<br/>

	The end's been settled; I show you an image<br/>
	of unwanted illusions<br/>
	If you want a future opposite,<br/>
	then come right to me and tell me about it<br/>

	I've got no interest in a calculated finish<br/>
	You know that, don't you?<br/>
	Don't hold yourself back out of impatience,<br/>
	and look at me<br/>

	I've stolen your heart; I won't avert my eyes<br/>
	Fall into me<br/>
	So deep your heart will stop beating<br/>

	Words fading away; send their heart-touching sound<br/>

	A heart vividly appears in the image,<br/>
	wavering like the heat haze, about to disappear<br/>
	If you want to hold onto it, show me<br/>
	to keep that light alive<br/>

	Eyes covered against the overly bright light<br/>
	Emotions buried in rubble<br/>
	If you want to save me,<br/>
	then grasp my hand right now<br/>
