	I long to meet you<br/>
	The path of my journey stretches beyond eternity<br/>
	Among the impermanence of all worldly things,<br/>
	that wish will never change...<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	Is this love a worldly passion?<br/>
	I'm unable to completely free myself of desires<br/>
	No need for words - I can tell by way of divine powers<br/>
	This karma is as if we had been together in a previous life<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	The days that I wept dismally<br/>
	For some reason, those are the memories I can't seem to forget<br/>
	Blunt at face, but actually kind at heart<br/>
	I'm urged to chase after that someone who resembles you so much<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	The gemstones that I had worked and worked so hard to build up<br/>
	Toppled and fell into millions of tiny pieces<br/>
	"All because of your lack of faith!"<br/>
	The deceptive evil spirit cackles, laughing as it mocks me<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	A true miracle is the final result of good karma<br/>
	Because it's no longer a miracle, but an<br/>
	unknown guiding power coming from within yourself<br/>
	I long to see you at any time<br/>
	With a mysterious synchronicity,<br/>
	our souls are connected deep within<br/>
	All of these unbounded emotions in the palm of your hand<br/>

	With the scent of nectar...<br/>

<tr><td>
	Shambhala; recklessly, without thought<br/>
	Above the unfortunate town,<br/>
	the cruel demon passes through<br/>
	I'll purify the cursed demon<br/>
	raging through my heart<br/>
	Just you watch,<br/>
	suspicious evil spirit!<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	I'm fine, I can handle myself!<br/>
	I said those distant words were because I wanted you to know<br/>
	I hate relying on others only at times like these<br/>
	I want to show you how I never give in<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	Oh, I'm being called out to, so drawn to you<br/>
	Can you fly away to a loving state with neither sky nor land?<br/>
	The questioning voices ask, "How about it?" laughing arrogantly<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	I can no longer name to these emotions about to fall to pieces<br/>
	Love, friendship, or whatever<br/>
	What I have here surpasses it all<br/>
	I long to meet you<br/>
	On this path of lotus flowers, somehow,<br/>
	our souls are connected deep within<br/>
	I want to cleanse these feelings forming a vortex going forth<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	All will end someday; that is what they call fate<br/>
	All that prospers must decline? Allow me to decline<br/>
	I want to<br/>
	be my own<br/>
	incarnation<br/>
	Ah<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	A true miracle is the final result of good karma<br/>
	Because it's no longer a miracle, but an<br/>
	unknown guiding power coming from within yourself<br/>
	So you may come to realize<br/>
	what has been suppressed by the raging river,<br/>
	the mandala of all living things<br/>
	I offer you these prayers, these words of my hopes<br/>

	With my thanks<br/>

<tr><td>
	Shangri-La; recklessly, without thought<br/>
	The cruel demon beckons invitingly<br/>
	That path is the path of evil<br/>
	The entrance is wide-open,<br/>
	but there's no escape<br/>
	I won't be deceived!<br/>
	Suspicious evil spirit<br/>
