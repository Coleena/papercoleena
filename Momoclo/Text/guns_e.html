    Once you step foot into this world,<br>
    you have no choice but to advance<br>
    Victory is a moment's ecstasy<br>
    Shadows closing in one after another<br>
    (I'm so scared)<br>
    The sky falls and vanishes unawares<br>
    Tears strewn with wounds<br>
    (But I know)<br>
    All hopes will be buried in ash<br>
    Voices of sympathy echoed<br>
    (Your chance will come again)<br>

    No way we're leaving this as a loss<br>
    A world such as this isn't good enough<br>
    In order to get what I want,<br>

    Put your life on the line and advance<br>

    Struck by a bullet of words<br>
    Falling into the darkness and wandering<br>
    In the life-sized mirror<br>
    My reflected self mocked me<br>
    Enough is enough, put me at ease already<br>
    The palm of a hand extended<br>
    Your true foe was within yourself<br>

    A world such as this isn't good enough<br>
    Whatever fate awaits, I will twist it<br>

    Tomorrow never knows, never knows<br>

    The heart is a universe<br>
    The end is the beginning<br>
    Foolish you may be, remain steadfast<br>
