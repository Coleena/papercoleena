    If, just if, I tired of waiting,<br>

    As I look up into the night skies,<br>
    golden flowers bloom<br>

    Once more,<br>
    just once more<br>
    I had wanted to show you<br>
    This ever beautiful world<br>

    I need you<br>
    Remember when you'd embraced me, saying you wanted only me?<br>
    Oh, while the warmth of your touch still remains...<br>

    I want it to keep burning on...<br>
