    I can't stop smiling!<br/>

    I've always seen you<br/> 
	in the same train car as me<br/>
    I wonder when it all started? When these feelings for you<br/>
    had grown so strong in my chest

    Unable to even start a conversation, I'd always<br/>

    as I watched you from the side of my eye

    But I'm tired of regretting things<br/>
    now that I've realized how I feel<br/>
    I don't want to run away<br/>
	by lying to myself, either<br/>
    Scooping everything up,<br/>
    not leaving a single bit behind<br/>
    I'll pour all of my feelings into these words

    Always thinking of nothing but excuses<br/>
    right before taking the first step,<br/>
    I end up unable to do a thing<br/>
    as time marches on without me<br/>
    My heart, all too used to forgetting,<br/>
    began to race, running forwards

    In comparison to this vast world,<br/>

    Waiting around won't start anything!<br/>
    I want to face you with all my willpower<br/>
    We were born on the same planet,<br/>
    born into the same generation<br/>
    To distance myself from you<br/>
	with a word as simple as "coincidence"-<br/>
    Just thinking about it makes my chest hurt<br/>
    I earnestly want to connect with you, even now<br/>
    Even in years, decades,<br/> from now on, into the future<br/>
    Because we've only got one shot at life<br/>
    I want to be honest when I'm with you

    But even so, I can't give you an answer<br/>
    I can't say aloud the smallest of words<br/>
    "I like you" â€“ Will just those three words<br/>
    change the world? Will they?
