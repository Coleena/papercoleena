	you always say that you are,<br/>

	Our time difference, distance, national borders,<br/>

	From me to you, I'm shouting out<br/>
	To carry this voice, this wind<br/>

	To your back, high-five! An air high-five!<br/>
	Even when apart, we're side-by-side<br/>
	To your back, high-five! A hearty high-five!<br/>

	C'mon, look up at the sky! Look more at the sky!<br/>
	Aha, you look dumb! See, we're connected!<br/>

	The shortest magic spell in the world is a name (It's yours)<br/>
