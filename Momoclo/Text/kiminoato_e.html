    Because I had to leave, I forcibly hid away<br/>
    my feelings for you, and they pound away at my chest<br/>

    Remnants which will never disappear - I love you...<br/>

    I'd never imagined a day like this would come<br/>
    A day I'd fall in love with someone<br/>
    But my voice won't come out<br/>

    these words the color of tears - I love you...<br/>

    The bus would leave the next day, taking me with it<br/>

    "It was hopeless from the start," I keep telling myself<br/>
    But only my heart realizes how much of a lie that is<br/>
    Sadness continues to pour down endlessly, like the rain<br/>
    The voice in me saying "I love you" will never disappear<br/>

    When the departing bell rang,<br/>
    you came running up, gasping for breath<br/>
    Half-smiling and half-crying,<br/>
    trying to tell me something<br/>
