    I'll go see you...<br/>
    My thoughts of you fall from the sky,<br/> piling up far past the eye can see<br/>
    I'll go see you...<br/>
    You and I paint our legend of pure-white snow

    You're no longer there<br/>
    on the Sobu line's local trains<br/>
    But as the traffic light changes at the intersection<br/>
    I still feel getting myself getting excited

    Unable to hold back<br/>
    a sudden urge to see you, I take off running<br/>
    Just a little further, almost there<br/>
    At the place of our promise

    I'll go see you...<br/>
    My thoughts of you fall from the sky,<br/> piling up far past the eye can see<br/>
    Your season, blindingly radiant<br/>
    has the passion of pure-white snow<br/>
    At the end of this journey, we've happened upon a miracle<br/>
    A dream which can't be seen alone

    A photo of you lying in the corner of my room<br/>
    puts a smile on my face each time I see yours<br/>
    Far apart as we are, I don't feel lonely<br/>
    because we share the same moments

    You make the days I'm all alone<br/>
    feel not so cold, warming them up<br/>
    Your voice resounds in my heart,<br/>
    making my chest tighten

    Come see me!<br/>
    On a night such as this,<br/>
    I can't bear to live without you<br/>
    My hand holds tightly onto your warmth,<br/>
    a ticket which will take me straight to you<br/>
    Dreams crossing over into one<br/>
    and a melody connecting heart to heart

    I engrave into my chest<br/>
    the light of a future walked by none<br/>
    I can't imagine a world without you<br/>
    Just you and me,<br/>
    can we experience the meaning of "fate"?
