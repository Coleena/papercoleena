    The sun's glaring rays pierce through my skin<br/>
	I can't wait any longer â€“ Let's go to that seashore<br/>
	The gulls are calling out; across the water's white horizon,<br/>
	the ocean's salty breeze brushes against my cheek, calling for me<br/>
	Let's sing! Let's dance!<br/>
	And let's go grasp happiness with our own hands<br/>

	Feel the joy of dashing across the smooth sand<br/>
	I'll share some with you, and some with you, too<br/>
	Toss your flip-flops into the ocean<br/>
	Watch the white ships, the red flowers; this is what summer is<br/>
	Let's laugh! Let's shout out!<br/>
	And let's keep dreaming of tomorrow<br/>
	Let's sing! Let's dance!<br/>
	And let's go grasp happiness with our own hands<br/>
	La-la-la-la la-la-la-la la-la-la-la<br/>
	la-la-la la-la la-la<br/>
