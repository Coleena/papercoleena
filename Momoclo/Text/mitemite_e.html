    Hey, look, look over here!<br/>
	I want you to look at me!<br/>
	When you're watching me, my heart races happily!<br/>

	Toss off my pajamas quickly, it's a new record!<br/>
	Drink some milk, I get a white moustache<br/>
	Do a funny impression of my favorite teacher<br/>
	Let's play pretend and walk around like models<br/>
	Butterfly kick, butterfly kick, take a breather<br/>
	Summer butts are pure white<br/>
	Be an Olympic flame-bearer with soft serve ice-cream<br/>

	Watched over by the blinding sun in the distance,<br/>
	we had tons of fun, just like yesterday!<br/>
	The sunset, gently burning in the distance,<br/>
	isn't a signal of the end; it's a preview of tomorrow!<br/>

	Nod good morning, my bed hair popping up<br/>
	Handstand against the wall, bellybutton sticking out<br/>
	My shoes are on backwards, right on left<br/>
	Spin my umbrella around and around, the rain lifts<br/>
	Stick out my tongue, eating strawberry shaved ice<br/>
	Here we go! Dribble; here's your chance, shoot!<br/>
	Hold our recital with toy mics<br/>

	We'll play in the dream world<br/>
	that the moon shining far away tells tales of<br/>
	When those twinkling stars slumber,<br/>
	a new glittery day will start!<br/>
