    The deep shadows the high-rises cast shut away the stars<br/>
	Just like a forest with no exit<br/>
	I have friends, but what is this loneliness, then?<br/>
	My smile always lies<br/>

	You've found a spot somewhere in my heart,<br/>

	A rain of glass falls,<br/>
	shutting the lock on my memories,<br/>
	enough to steal away my dreams<br/>
	The city harbors a pain no other understands<br/>
	All alone, I break down,<br/>
	tears in my eyes<br/>

	When I escape to the noise of a cafe,<br/>
	it feels as though my voice could be lost<br/>
	The looks of others from an unremarkable distance<br/>
	could make me forget who I am someday<br/>

	A rain of glass falls<br/>
	and all seems as if it were an illusion<br/>
	Nothing but futility left by my side<br/>
	Embracing these unseen feelings deeply,<br/>
	I'm shivering all alone,<br/>
	tears in my eyes<br/>
