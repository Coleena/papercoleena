    Are these feelings reaching you?<br/>
    My words disappear into the sky<br/>

    In a corner of the campus, beyond the curtain,<br/>
	you danced as I watched<br/>
    Afterschool is the only time I can meet you<br/>
    It's our little secret<br/>

    "Stay honest to yourself, okay?"<br/>
    Those nonchalant words on the corner of my notebook<br/>
    are all I need to try my best<br/>
    Because it's you, and no one else, I won't waver

    This day is a once-in-a-lifetime magic<br/>
    So it won't ever stop, and so we can be proud of it<br/> 
    Let's make today that way<br/>
    I grasped tightly to my chest the feelings I'd always hidden<br/>
    You and I make our very own story<br/>
    on this orange notebook

    Are these feelings reaching you?<br/>
    My words disappear into the sky<br/>

    The May wind blows through<br/>
    the gap between the sky's blue and the clouds<br/>
    Weekends are the only time I can meet you<br/>
    I won't let anyone get in the way of that

    On the days when I couldn't say a word through my tears,<br/>
    on the days when I couldn't move or stand<br/>
    you stayed by my side<br/>
    There's something I want to tell you: "Thank you!"

    I can't stop these feelings, right here in my chest<br/>
    All of them are overflowing<br/>

    Daydreaming all the time is boring<br/>
    No one will know unless you put them to words<br/>
    Ride on, you're on top<br/>
    That train of thought's on the verge of shorting out<br/>
    You'll know when it comes to it<br/>
    What you're looking for is buried deep in your chest, for sure

    I gently grasped onto<br/>
    this big dream<br/>
    Because it'll give us strength,<br/>
    (because there's no stopping it,)<br/>
    it starts to move<br/>
	as if it'll come true...<br/>
