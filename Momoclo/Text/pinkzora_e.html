    Pink skies bridge today and tomorrow in the setting sun<br>
    Pink skies coloring the musical sheets in my heart, five lines apiece<br>
</td></tr>

    An unreachable eternity suddenly emerges,<br>
    and I stand, unable to run, entranced by the pink skies<br>

    The end of this road stretches up into space<br>
    A ship with no return, the day will eventually come for this planet<br>
    when it turns into a star which lights the skies,<br>
    twinkling on until then<br>
    Sing: Life is one time - life is one time...<br>

    Will we awaken from a dream? Life is no dream<br>
    Human life is short-lived, you and I an unreachable eternity<br>
    A kiss to each day, new pages we flip open with a rustle...<br>
    How much longer will they last? Thank you, pink skies...<br>

    Before I fall into a deep sleep, I think of you<br>
    All the sides of you I got to meet make my heart race...<br>
    And now, towards an unknown future<br>
    A future we have yet to encounter<br>
    Let the sound resonate through the world's future<br>
    Let it reach this world's future...<br>

    As if it were a movie, as if it were a manga,<br>
    the moments fall apart, and we question<br>
    what we can call love, and reflect it in our hearts<br>
    We can't afford to let this tragedy end, painful as it is<br>

    Embracing the happiness of<br>
    the morning sun returning to our town,<br>
    let's live our present with no return<br>

    Cross through our present<br>
    which can't be conquered through smiles alone<br>
    I build a rainbow bridge, offering my tears to the sun...<br>
</td></tr>

    I will be waiting right here, standing at the place of our beginnings<br>
    Having awakened from a dream, offering my tears to the sun...<br>

<tr><td>
    Like the season I'll pursue love once again,<br>
    I offer the breaking sun and moon to my tears...<br>

    Life is one time<br>
    No one take your life into dreams<br>
    Life is one time<br>
    Let's tell a story<br>
    of this day we've awakened from the dream of life...<br>
