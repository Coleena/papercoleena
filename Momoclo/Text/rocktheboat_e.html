	What does your yes really mean?<br>
    Constantly living on autopilot<br>
    Never trying your fullest<br>
    Never sticking with what you start<br>

	Dreamers all say the same thing, fools that they are<br>
    Don't you settle for "good enough"<br>
    Gettin' to know anxiety real well<br>
    Oh, that's not what you'd planned on doing, was it?<br>

    Rock the boat! Open your eyes<br>
    Rock, rock the boat<br>
    Make some waves in these inconsequential, monotonous days<br>
    Do it - destroy it!<br>
    Keep acting the good kid, and you'll head nowhere<br>
    All those rules, all those standards<br>
    Are asking to be broken<br>

    Well? Will you rock it?<br>

    Today, tomorrow, and the future<br>
    They're all connected by land<br>
    As for me, I'm picking up speed<br>
    Took off running a little too fast<br>

    You can't control your breaths, can you?<br>
    The lying crow laughs in your face<br>
    You're always causing trouble for others<br>
    Leaving it behind once you've got what you want<br>

    Rock the boat! Right now<br>
    Rock, rock the boat<br>
    Don't dwell on thoughts, just go ahead<br>
    Do it - break the waves!<br>
    Drill a hole through your old self and take a look at the world<br>
    The sun might even rise from the west<br>

    So, will you rock it?<br>

    I never had one single desire to leave<br>
    Embarking on the ocean<br>
    Yet atop the raging waves<br>
    I feel so good...<br>
