    On the usual path home,<br/>
    I make my way through the crowds<br/>
    Not paying attention to a word my friends said,<br/>
    my mind instinctively searched for you
</td></tr>

    As much as I talk about them,<br/>
    I don't get "love" or "romance" at all<br/>
    But I knew in an instant this feeling<br/>
    was definitely attraction

    I'll continue walking on<br/>
    in the direction my heart points<br/>
    I will believe in the path I've chosen<br/>
    and move forwards, seeing where it takes me<br/>
    Of course there'll be hardships,<br/>
    but there will also be good things<br/>
    All so my feelings<br/>
    will someday reach you

    I want to see you, I want to hear your voice<br/>
    My hand reaches out towards my cell phone<br/>
    but I don't want you to realize how I feel<br/>
    and end up unable to do a thing<br/>
    I reached out towards the unknown tomorrow<br/>
    and tried drawing out the future<br/>
    but was stuck regretting yesterday,<br/>
    and then the sun rose

    Whenever I meet you,<br/>
