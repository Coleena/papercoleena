	My first love! My first kiss!<br/>

	Today, we went out to a street fair<br/>
	Weather filled to the brim with energy<br/>
	So our love will never wither away,<br/>
	I'll give you this cactus as a present!<br/>
	As we traveled across a sunlit veranda<br/>
	You tripped, and your hands slipped!<br/>
	With a sway, and a swoosh, and a shatter<br/>
	The flowerpot broke into pieces... wait, whoa!<br/>

	That was a big oops! I gathered up the teracotta fragments<br/>
	We can put it back together! It's fine, I forgive you!<br/>
	Bring me some instant glue<br/>
	Just swirl a ribbon around it from above<br/>
	See? It got even cuter!<br/>
	If you ever have a broken heart,<br/>
	I'll keep it safe within my arms<br/>

	The small cut on your finger stings<br/>
	I place a band-aid on it, and squeeze it tight with a kiss!<br/>

	Cactus with a ribbon<br/>
	Blown in the dancing wind<br/>
	When I'm with you, just that fact<br/>
	Makes the sunshine seem brighter<br/>
	Huff, huff, puff, inflating<br/>
	If this dream floating in a siesta<br/>
	fell atop the cactus's thorns<br/>
	Would it burst and disappear?<br/>

	This heartbeat is the urge that makes me want to spoil you<br/>
	But I act tough, read, and wait<br/>
	And end up keeping myself back<br/>
	She's a rather awkward girl<br/>
	A girl who can't seem to grow up<br/>
	See, it's just not like her - she loves him so much<br/>
	She's started to even feel anxious!<br/>
	So their love may continue forever,<br/>
	she filters and cleanses her heart<br/>

	The inside of my chest feels barren when I'm lonely<br/>
	But once I hear your voice, it's as if<br/>
	water's flowing through, I'm healed<br/>

<tr><td>
	What a kind atmosphere<br/>
	Even for my shy heart<br/>
	Just looking at you, just that<br/>
	Makes flowers bloom, like it's a miracle<br/>
	If it's from you,<br/>
	I don't need a whole bouquet<br/>
	Just a single flower is fine<br/>
	Isn't that right, cactus with a ribbon?<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	Let's entwine our fingers<br/>
	and dance together<br/>
	In this sacred place<br/>
	where the stars fall<br/>
	Awakening cactus<br/>
	Once the magic disappears, the prince will appear<br/>
	And then what will become of their fate?!<br/>
