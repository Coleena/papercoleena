	The morning we were born, we were handed a<br/>
	rather unfair travelling bag that we've carried with us<br/>
	to this place of learning<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	Quick to envy, looking down on others at times<br/>
	Our cowardly selves clashing<br/>
	as our shining luggage kept increasing<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	All too many things have happened<br/>
	We simply repeat the words we could never say right<br/>
	Ah, just the words "I'm sorry" and "Thank you," over and over...<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	Our memories will be our source of courage<br/>
	Holding tightly onto the dreams we had found individually<br/>
	On a path so long we could never hope to reach the end<br/>
	Even so, we will simply continue to walk on resolutely...<br/>

	"Friends. We may be parting today..."<br/>
	"Friends. But this pain within..."<br/>
	"Friends. Proves the depth of our love."<br/>
	"Friends. Don't forget."<br/>
	"Friends. Our radiant..."<br/>

	The last bell breaks through the air and resounds<br/>
	Your shoulders trembled ever so faintly<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	We close our eyes just once more,<br/>
	and say with a deep breath,<br/>
	Ah, "Farewell" and "Thank you" for now...<br/>
</td></tr>

	When they broke, we picked up the pieces and put them back together<br/>
	Once we regain our grip our slightly chipped dreams<br/>
	Even as we find ourselves in doubt or as we cry, we will never stop<br/>
	aiming for the brightest future, starting here...<br/>

<tr><td>
	How many billion light years of solitude?<br/>
	Although we may always be apart, if you look<br/>
	from the bottom of these skies, we've still clung on<br/>
	If anything happens, even if there is nothing,<br/>
	we softly vow in our chests to take flight...<br/>

	La la la, la la la la...<br/>
	The wind still blows cold<br/>
	La la la, la la la la...<br/>
	But we will keep our heads up<br/>
