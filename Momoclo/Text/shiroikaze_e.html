    Beyond the wind shining pure white,<br/>

    Please, don't let that smile vanish from your face<br/>

    I took off running across the asphalt with all my courage<br/>
    so I'll be able to advance as far as I can to the future<br/>
    The miracle of meeting you, and to always be myself<br/>
    I'll keep it all close to my heart<br/>

    Let these feelings crying out in my chest reach you<br/>
