	Hold up, Tamai!<br/>
	Coming straight to my room the moment we arrive at the hotel...<br/>
	Isn't something a little strange about that?

	Luggage storeroom!<br/>

	Besides, Tamai! Aren't you a junior now?<br/>
	Suddenly falling asleep anywhere, even here,<br/>
	I can't believe you!<br/>
	Well, I do have to say I myself was surprised<br/>
	when I fell asleep in the shower!<br/>
	Make more of an effort to pull yourself together!<br/>
	Oh, who cares! Why don't you be more tolerant?<br/>
	I don't want to see you start clinging onto me!<br/>
	You cheapo!!<br/>
	You're such a kid!<br/>
	I am a kid!

	She's absolutely hopeless when I'm not around<br/>

	Nothing's strange at all<br/>
	But this bed's too small...<br/>
	I don't mind if you cling onto me!<br/>
	Your face is too close<br/>
	I've gotten sleepy...<br/>
	Just the two of us in our own single bed</br>

	You know, you've been talking big for a while now<br/>
	but you're quite the scaredy-cat yourself!<br/>
	Well, I will admit that when I use the bathroom alone at night,<br/>
	I start reciting my prayers to the Buddha<br/>
	See, it's okay since I'm here to sleep with you!<br/>
	Says the one who always cries when she's left alone!<br/>
	How about we say we're both to blame and then call it a night?<br/>
	Have you been listening to me at all?<br/>
	I'm listening!<br/>
	Aargh, how annoying!

	Mm... I mean, I was half-asleep!<br/>
	No way!<br/>
	I'm not always half-asleep, am I?<br/>
	You are. I've noticed, <br/>
	whenever I take a bath or start doing things,<br/> 
	you fall asleep at once.<br/>
	Oh, I guess I tend to get sleepy<br/>
	whenever I take a bath.<br/>
	And then, see, if I come out while you're asleep,<br/>
	won't I wake you up?<br/>
	So when I interrupt your sleep,<br/> 
	you'll keep asking me to spoil you.<br/>
	Wow, cute!<br/>
