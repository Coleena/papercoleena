    Take the mistakes of yesterday<br>
    Drop them into a cup of tea and drink them away<br>
    Turning off the morning news,<br>
    I opened the door - c'mon, let's set off<br>

    "Morning," you'd tell me in front of the classroom<br>
    Your familiar voice and face<br>
    Don't change who you are, no matter how many centuries pass<br>
    Promise me, okay?<br>
    If only these days would last forever...<br>

    The sky's curtain connects countless winters<br>
    Cold sighs filling the clear skies with white<br>
    The earth goes 'round and 'round<br>
    Don't worry, keep moving - you will always be you<br>

    We play with our phones,<br>
    reaffirming our futures<br>
    Bury our worries in the snow<br>
    "Follow your dreams," "be realistic"<br>
    Which is it, professor?<br>
    Believe me, please<br>

    The moon at dawn smiled faintly<br>
    Unaware of the meaning of "good-bye"<br>
    The sound of my heart beats in unison with the clock<br>
    Moving the time within me - tick-tock, tick-tock<br>
    Another day<br>

    The sky's curtain connects our individual lives<br>
    Tears filling the clear skies, ever-changing signals<br>
    The earth goes 'round and 'round<br>
    It's not lonely - we share this winter<br>

    Memories blow by in the harsh winds,<br>
    sometimes causing the gaps in our hearts to hurt<br>
    It's okay to cry - don't run<br>
    The morning sun you can see is the future<br>

    Ring-dong, ring-dong<br>
    Let my voice sound out<br>
    Ring-dong, ring-dong<br>
    Before I grow up, I want to laugh more<br>
    I want to experience excitement, make my dreams come true...<br>

    The words found in the library<br>
    Can't teach the meaning of real pain<br>
    When will I be able to see beginnings and ends?<br>
    After all, spring comes without fail every year<br>
    Standing at a crossroad, which path will bring me to the finish line?<br>
    It's okay - when you reach a dead end,<br>
    don't be afraid to turn back and start again...<br>
