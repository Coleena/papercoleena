	A shower of light rains down on its eyelids<br/>
	and the blue sky wakes up<br/>
	It's like I've forgotten<br/>
	all my loneliness and the tears from last night<br/>
	See you later!<br/>

	Chasing after and trying to get closer to you<br/>
	Isn't this natural happiness beautiful?<br/>
	It's so mysterious<br/>
	There's a certain shining rule not taught in textbooks<br/>
	That's what your sun taught me<br/>

	When you take a long time to reply to my emails,<br/>
	I start to feel anxious<br/>
	Instead of waiting, all alone in my room,<br/>
	it's better to open up the door and go outside!<br/>
	Yeah!<br/>

<tr><td>
	Even though I can't see you and can't talk to you,<br/>
	it feels like I can believe we're connected<br/>
	Up the level!<br/>
	Knowing the heart is more important than acing tests<br/>
	When I looked up at the sky again, your sun was there<br/>

<tr><td>
	Fighting and disagreeing,<br/>
	when the skies clear, the two of us grow up<br/>
	Longer, longer<br/>
	I want to be with you until we're dyed in sunset<br/>
	so I'll give your sun dimples<br/>
