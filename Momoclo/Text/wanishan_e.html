    Underneath the scorching hot sun,<br/>
    tanned a light brown<br/>
    Live shows, bikinis, tests of courage,<br/>
    the best summer vacation ever!<br/>
    Before I knew it, the 31st had come,<br/>
    and my face turned purple as a ghost<br/>
    At the bottom of my bag laid<br/>
    a huge pile of untouched worksheets<br/>

    From the last day of school until today, <br/>
    the days have flown by<br/>
    Camp, events, watermelon-splitting, <br/>
    making precious memories<br/>
    It's not like I actually <i>forgot</i>, per-se, <br/>
    but there was definitely something big I missed<br/>
    I'm sure it'll work out, right? <br/>
    Mechanical pencil in hand, it's a showdown!!<br/>

    Dear God, please give me back my first semester!<br/>

    Times passes,<br/>
