    See, you're behaving that way again,<br/>
    and still can't get how you feel across<br/>
    How long will you keep up the act?<br/>
    Your real self is creaking<br/>
    How much more must I hesitate,<br/> 
    how much further must I walk?<br/>
    Crying when disagreeing with others<br/>
    I'll break countless taboos for my precious love

    Momoclo steps onstage! How're you all feeling?<br/>
    The two brothers over there<br/>
    are on a great voyage, rowing their star ship<br/>

    Because you can't do a thing alone,<br/>
    you've spent the whole time hiding your weakness<br/>
    Because of this, I sometimes stay with you,<br/>
    acting as your support<br/>
    Living through countless ages,<br/>
    how many more will I have to get through?<br/>
    It's like a drama - I lose something every time<br/>
    Nothing will corrupt our crystal light
