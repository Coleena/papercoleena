    Full-power girl!<br/>
    I love you with all I've got,<br/>
    and I just want to tell you that one fact all the time<br/>
    I think of you and only you with all I've got<br/>
    because I've seriously fallen in love!<br/>

    That day, in the classroom lit by the setting sun,<br/>
    I dropped my tear-soaked handkerchief<br/>
    And you, happening to pass by after school,<br/>
    picked it up for me<br/>

    The way you held it out to me awkwardly<br/>
    somehow made me feel calm<br/>
    You always gave off a shy impression<br/>
    but I got the chance to talk to you for the first time<br/>

    My heart clenches,<br/>
    and squeezes<br/>
    Don't tell me,<br/>
    could you be my first crush?!<br/>

    I want to tell you, "I love you!!"<br/>

    Grant my wish, 4-leaf clover<br/>

    Why is it that why whenever you laugh,<br/>
    I'm pulled along into a cheerful mood too<br/>
    Why is it that whenever I talk to you,<br/>
    my voice starts to go squeaky?<br/>

    Why is it that I've started wanting to know<br/>
