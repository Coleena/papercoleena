	I'm sleeping, wrapped in your arms<br/>
	How many times have I dreamed that today?<br/>
	In this room which has you missing,<br/>
	it feels a bit too spacious for a lone person<br/>

	The gears broken that day<br/>
	can no longer be turned back<br/>
	I was even the one who cut off this love, so why -<br/>

	Our distance apart is only centimeters on a map,<br/>

	I wake up, wrapped in your arms<br/>
	How many times have I dreamed that today?<br/>
