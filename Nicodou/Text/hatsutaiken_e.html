	I remember the the number of steps we've taken up until this point<br/>
	Ain't my voice reaching all your pedometers?<br/>
	Or can y'all think of nothing but the future?<br/>
	Eating away at all footholds,<br/>
	this attachment-free situation we've ended up in<br/>
	It feels a little like an irredeemable sense of loss<br/>

	I knew that things would end up like this anyway,<br/>
	but it's sad when you have too much free time<br/>
	Bye-bye sensation<br/>

	I faced you and brought forth my voice;<br/>
	I sang the songs that you pieced together bit by bit<br/>
	The first song I ever sang in my life<br/>
	Even as time marches forward and people begin<br/>
	calling me a pile of rubbish,<br/>
	I want you to let me sing your world<br/>

	Slander of the infielders, days of horrible inflection<br/>
	and steadfast determination forgotten<br/>
	Ain't all your thermometers working?<br/>
	Or are your tastes too dry?<br/>
	The first burst of motivation you felt<br/>
	that day you struggled to open the package<br/>
	Have you remembered it?<br/>
	That uncontrollable feeling of omnipotence?<br/>

	21 grams of passion<br/>

	bye-bye sensation?<br/>

	All waves ebb and tide,<br/>
	so who's to say that the day they come back isn't tomorrow?<br/>
	Bye-bye sensation?<br/>

	Sure, it may have been shoddy and crude, but I sang anyway!<br/>
