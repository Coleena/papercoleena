    Who's the one who looks like they're 'bout to cry all the time?<br/>
	Strike back at them as much as you were laughed at<br/>
	What I'd took into my hand while shouting, "I'll show you!"<br/>
	was neither a bomb nor knife<br/>
	Let's promise, no matter what happens from here on out,<br/>
	to tear off the price tag on your back<br/>
	After all, although this daily life of ours is like scrap wood,<br/>
	it's still too early to throw it away<br/>

	Still trembling, like always,<br/>
	on the platform of the terminal station,<br/>
	my self of tomorrow is still waiting<br/>
	to welcome back a selfish, dense master<br/>

	Cars are going to eventually fly the skies in years, but even so<br/>
	Machines will be able to talk in years, but even so<br/>
	Just what's with that?<br/>
	Before you call it "convenient",<br/>
	please heal the open wounds in this heart<br/>
	If missiles fly through that such sky,<br/>
	and I ask for happiness from such a thing,<br/>
	I have to become a kind person<br/>
	Will I be able to be satisfied with myself...?<br/>

	They all say to raise your head high and face forwards,<br/>
	but in the dark, you can't tell shit from front<br/>
	Whether alone or with another,<br/>
	loneliness will always be loneliness<br/>

	Singing about wanting to die, those sorts of songs<br/>
	All I got was "That again?" and a stake through my chest<br/>
	And yet, even with something as simple as that,<br/>
	no matter what I do, I can't seem to find<br/>
	the words spilling from my lips<br/>

	The me of today will again, like always,<br/>
	lose myself in the game arcade<br/>
	It'd be nice if tomorrow just never came<br/>
	The steam whistle of the final train resounds annoyingly loud<br/>

	Even if I hide my unhappiness, bluffing, "Who needs love?"<br/>
	It'll definitely assault my conscience<br/>
	How's it going, present me?<br/>
	I see, there's nothing we can do<br/>
	I absolutely hate someone as annoying as you<br/>
	If missiles fly through that such sky,<br/>
	and lives are lost from such a thing,<br/>
	I have to become a kind person<br/>
	I want to be able to be satisfied with myself<br/>
	I have to become a kind person<br/>
	before my heart numbs from the cold<br/>
