Lose all hesitation and doubts<br/>
and you can gaze all you want<br/>
A increasingly-sharp glint in my eye<br/>
cuts through even the air<br/>

As long as you do not let fear draw close,<br/>
you can talk on all you want<br/>
A violently restive pounding in my chest<br/>
marks the passage of time<br/>

Laugh at the dark night,<br/>
as if tired of waiting<br/>
The eyes of the moon are red<br/>

Our resonance of this scorching sensation<br/>
points to a shining future,<br/>

Our resonance of this scorching sensation<br/>
points to the center of a world burst open,<br/>
inviting everything, everything<br/>

The two thinly-continuing lines now<br/>
accept a sad meeting carrying much fury<br/>
Is their intersection an inevitability?<br/>
Are they fated to cross paths?<br/>
To intently pierce<br/>
through innocence<br/>
If your wish were granted...<br/>
If your hope were granted...<br/>
would you like to hold hands and smile?<br/>
My feelings hidden inside<br/>
now point towards the darkness....<br/>

Our resonance of this scorching sensation<br/>
points to a shining future,<br/>
inviting everything, everything<br/>
What these honed nerves<br/>
release and capture is<br/>
life and will<br/>
This untouched proof<br/>
is like a blazing flame<br/>
as it burns everything to the ground<br/>
I will return you to nothingness<br/>
We now face the beginning<br/>
of our destinies<br/>
