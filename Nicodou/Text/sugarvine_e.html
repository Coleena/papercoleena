Last night came upon me<br/>
a breakup convo that fell like a sudden rain<br/>
I see<br/>
Oh well, then<br/>
Here, have some water,<br/>
sugarvine<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
So just like that, I got on the bus,<br/>
went to a cafe I'd been wanting to try out,<br/>
and drank some African coffee<br/>
dunno where, though<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
You're not here,<br/>
That's all I can think, moping around<br/>
but on the other side of window,<br/>
the wonderful world's still spinning, just like it does any other day<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Yes, shoop shoop<br/>
That's probably-bly<br/>
Enough reason to whoop whoop<br/>
a little; yep, that's the kind of situation it is<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Shoop, shoop<br/>
Make this gloomy mood, mood<br/>
Clear up with a whoop whoop<br/>
that's how much you matter<br/>
</td></tr>

Today, I cleaned my house<br/>
from morning, even the windows<br/>
Fruit sauce pancakes<br/>
I tried my hand at making,<br/>
but burnt them<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
There's no one for me to give them to,<br/>
so I braced myself and ate them all<br/>
the contrast between the berries and the burnt parts<br/>
surprisingly wasn't too bad, but that's not enough<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
I wanna see you<br/>
I think as I keep on crying<br/>
but when I open the window,<br/>
there waits a bright world, just like any other day<br/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Yes, shoop shoop<br/>
that's probably-bly<br/>
enough reason to whoop whoop<br/>
a little; yep, that's the kind of situation it is<br/>

He's a sugarvine<br/>
Can't live without water,<br/>
and doesn't care if the one pouring it is me or not<br/>
I'm a sugarvine, too<br/>
Search for rain all you want<br/>
on my dry cheeks; endings are new beginnings<br/>

make this gloomy mood, mood<br/>
clear up with a whoop whoop<br/>
because I am me, and nobody else<br/>
