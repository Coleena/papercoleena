    How long will I be able to keep up the act?</br>
    Will I be able to say good-bye when you want to go home?</br>

    The signs I'd missed that day fade bit by bit</br>
    But I'm sure things will be fine - we'll meet again, just as we have...</br>

    I must go</br>
    Call that the most beautiful thing in the world,</br>
