	Set my mind on writing a letter that can't be expressed with words<br/>
	I'd been considering sending it to the person<br/>
	I'd be in the days to come,<br/>
	but I don't have an address to send it to,<br/>
	and don't know where I am, either...<br/>
	So then what am I supposed to do with these feelings?<br/>

	How's it feel to have become someone you never wanted to be?<br/>
	god's laughing up there in heaven, pointing his finger down at you<br/>
	Shut up, you useless piece of shit; hurry up and get out of my sight<br/>
	The misery grows upon you bitterly...<br/>

	Squinting, turning away from love<br/>
	and being shut in a 6-tatami room, that's terrorism<br/>
	This whole time, I've been singing out -<br/>
	no, I've been crying out<br/>
	If you say that's wrong,<br/>
	then take a bullet heavier than those words<br/>
	and shoot<br/>

	When struck at, strike back - it's your turn now!<br/>
	It's time for you to seize every single dream thrown away<br/>
	I've bet my heart's place on this resistance<br/>
	A coup d'etat of life, so to speak<br/>
	Neither victories nor any losses<br/>
	through overtime<br/>
	It's the eve of our counteroffensive<br/>

	I used to earnestly believe that things could change<br/>
	if I put my thoughts to song<br/>
	I'd thought simply that without<br/>
	embarrassment or guilt<br/>
	Domination and the like,<br/>
	who's talking about that?<br/>
	Guess aren't any huge idiots who would here...<br/>

	Trapped by fear of the voices<br/>
	of the heartless crowd, that's terrorism<br/>
	Just like that, I've rejected others -<br/>
	no, I've run from them<br/>
	If this is our final chance, then for this terrible stage...<br/>
	Thanks, but no thanks<br/>

	When struck at, strike back - it's your turn now!<br/>
	Ignore all those who abuse and jeer at you<br/>
	A cry for help leaks out from the wounds in my heart, mayday<br/>
	Laugh back as much as you were laughed at, but no more<br/>
	This intifada occurred in a single room<br/>
	A defensive battle with neither soldiers nor officers<br/>
	It's the eve of our revolution<br/>

	Even when worn out, take it back<br/>
	Your heart is yours and yours alone<br/>
	Life shines so brightly because that's what makes it life<br/>
	You may fall over, trip, or collapse,<br/>
	but that is proof you tried to advance forwards<br/>
	That's why anyone who laughs at that is the worst<br/>
	But despite everything, the world'll keep going 'round<br/>
	Is that right? Is it?<br/>
	give me an answer...<br/>
