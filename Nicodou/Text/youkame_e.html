    Afterschool, before the rain stops,<br/>
	sing together with me<br/>
	an awkwardly-made, unsuccessful song<br/>
	still in the works<br/>
	At least at the very end,<br/>
	I hope that my words reach you -<br/>
	hey...<br/>

	Tomorrow will be as so kind to us as today,<br/>
	so don't spend it crying out of loneliness as well -<br/>
	come over here to me<br/>
	Because I know you can change<br/>
	with one small sliver of courage<br/>
	Now, don't let go of this hand<br/>

	Another day alone on the Seibu Line,<br/>
	shutting myself away in the world of my headphones<br/>
	I'd been drawing out stories which couldn't ever be true<br/>
	Going through what-ifs -<br/>
	even if "the end of the world" were to come,<br/>
	it'd leave behind utopia and nothing else;<br/>
	those kinds of cliched, overdone miracles<br/>

	Afterschool, before the rain stops,<br/>
	go search for me<br/>
	The me who'd kept<br/>
	my true name hidden<br/>
	Though we'll most likely forget<br/>
	the way we felt without realizing it -<br/>
	hey...<br/>

	This gentle love song played by machines,<br/>
	and this unbelievably wonderful fairytale -<br/>
	I hope, just as much as anyone else does,<br/>
	that they play on into the future,<br/>
	which is why I now ask this of God<br/>

	Onto the traces of interrupted tears, orange overflows<br/>
	The sunset sky is beautiful as ever, never changing<br/>
	And were that a lie, I wouldn't mind, so I'd like to say:<br/>
	thank you for showing me this illusion<br/>
	for just a moment<br/>

	Rolling down our cheeks, the voice of the world<br/>
	resounded loud and clear<br/>
	People called it a "pulse" and listened carefully<br/>
	We can't learn unless we know pain,<br/>
	so we gave this shoddily-made organ a name -<br/>
	we called it a "heart"...<br/>

	If we must cling onto days<br/>
	we can no longer return to,<br/>
	then let's leave them as happy memories<br/>
	and move onwards<br/>
	Because we've got legs to walk with<br/>
	and a future to head towards<br/>

	Until the morning sun rises,<br/>
	sing with me<br/>
	this awkwardly-made, unsuccessful song<br/>
	still in the works<br/>
	Once we do that, I think my words<br/>
	will reach you<br/>

	Now, "On the Eighth Day, Before the Rain Stops",<br/>
