	With the flickering flashlight, you quietly melt away<br/>
	Once I knew it, I had turned all upside-down in a dream<br/>

	The sun sets, and I can no longer fall asleep<br/>
	I again miss the night's coming<br/>
	In this town dyed in evening<br/>

	Now,<br/>
	If, and just if, you were to taint our tomorrow<br/>
	even these scorching days would change<br/>
	As if to meaninglessly confirm your existence<br/>

	Going 'round, impatience and summer rumors<br/>

	Oh, how it suffocates me,<br/>
	I always hated the summer<br/>
	"Hurry up and turn to night,"<br/>
	so I had wished, and wished<br/>
	These days end in such simplicity<br/>
	it makes me wearisome...<br/>

	Now,<br/>
	If, and just if, we'd been able to turn our backs to the future<br/>
	and sleep soundly, perhaps we would've been happy<br/>
	We'd fallen into the depths of the dusk waiting for night to come<br/>
	Unable to even say good-bye, I'd simply pulled your hand along<br/>
	Those were lovably pathetic days<br/>
